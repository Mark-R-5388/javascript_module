learning how to set up modules for cleaner looking code and practicality

For this short little exercise i set up a 2 button page that when clicked, will bring up a clients experience level and the method of workout training.
My goals for this exercise were...
1. set up the functionality of the buttons so they each loaded a different text into the container space.
2. Work a little CSS to add a little variability when clicking the buttons.
3. Set up seperate modules to keep the file size smaller for my app.js and practice exporting and importing these modules.
